# TreeAlgorithms

This is the summary for TreeAlgorithms. To see the reference, [go here](reference.md).

## Abstract

`<jv/tree-algorithms.hpp>` provides several utilities to iterate over a tree represented as a node sequence.
This allows to represent a tree as a sequence of nodes (for instance `std::vector<Node>`), instead of pointers to relatives.
This is beneficial for cache-locality.

## Explanatory example

For instance, the following expression `sqrt( pow(3,2) + pow(4,2) )` corresponds to this tree:

```
sqrt
|-> add
    |-> pow
    |   |-> 3
    |   |-> 2
    |-> pow
        |-> 4
        |-> 2
```

This can be translated in the following sequence:

```cpp
using MathTree = vector<OperationOrValue>;
MathTree sequence { Operation::Sqrt, Operation::Add, Value{3}, Value{2}, Operation::Pow, Value{4}, Value{2} };
```
(`OperationOrValue` could be a `std::unique_ptr` to a polymorphic base class, or to a `std::variant<Operation, Value>`...)

To exploit this using tree algorithms, we need to provide a `NodeTraits`.
This is because, in order to retrieve the tree structure, we need to know the number of children of every node.
In this example, operations have two children, and values have zero children.
```cpp
struct MyNodeTraits : jv::NodeTraits<MathTree::iterator, MyNodeTraits> {
    static std::size_t getChildrenCount(iterator it) noexcept {
        if (*it is Operation) 
            return 2;
        else
            return 0;
    }
};
```

Note that `jv::NodeTraits` is a template instantiated with `MathTree::iterator` and `MyNodeTraits`.
The first template argument of `jv::NodeTraits` is the iterator type of the sequence.
It must meet the requirements of `InputIterator`.
The second template argument of `jv::NodeTraits` is the node traits we are creating.
This is called `CRTP` (_Curiously Recurring Template Pattern_).
It can be considered the equivalent of virtual polymorphism for templates.

Once this is done, we can call algorithms on the tree.
```cpp
double evaluate_tree(MathTree const& tree) {
    // this calls the provided function for each child, then it is called for their 
    // parent using the values generated by its children.
    auto [value, tree_end] = MyNodeTraits::evaluationTraversal<double>(
        tree.begin(),
        [](MathTree::iterator node, double* begin, double* end) {
            // begin and end is a range of the children's evaluation values.
            if (*node is Operation) {
                assert(end - begin == 2); // number of children is 2
                return (*node as Operation)->apply(begin[0], begin[1]);
            } else {
                assert(end - begin == 0); // number of children is 0
                return (*node as Value)->get_value();
            }
        });
    assert(tree_end == tree.end());
    return value;
}
```
